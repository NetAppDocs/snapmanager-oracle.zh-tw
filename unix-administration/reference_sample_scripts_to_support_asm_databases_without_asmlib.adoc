# Set full full permission for this file to be called while rebooting and restore
chmod 777 /etc/initasmdisks

# If the /etc/initasmdisks needs to be updated in all the RAC nodes
# or /etc/initasmdisks script has to be executed in the RAC nodes, then the following
# section needs to be uncommented and used.
#
# Note: To do scp or running scripts in remote RAC node via ssh, it needs password less login
# for root user with ssh keys shared between the two nodes.
#
# The following 2 lines are used for updating the file in the RAC nodes:
# scp /etc/initasmdisks root@racnode1:/etc/initasmdisks
# scp /etc/initasmdisks root@racnode2:/etc/initasmdisks
#
# In order to execute the /etc/initasmdisks in other RAC nodes
# The following must be added to the master RAC node /etc/initasmdisks file
# from the asmmain.sh script itself. The above scp transfer will make sure
# the permissions and mode for the disk list contents are transferred to the other RAC nodes
# so now appending any command in the /etc/initasmsdisks will be retained only in the master RAC node.
# The following lines will add entries to the /etc/initasmsdisks file in master RAC node only. When this script is executed
#  master RAC node, /etc/initasmdisks in all the RAC nodes will be executed.
# echo 'ssh racnode1 /etc/initasmdisks' >> /etc/initasmdisks
# echo 'ssh racnode2 /etc/initasmdisks' >> /etc/initasmdisks
